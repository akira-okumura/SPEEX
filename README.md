# SPEEX2
Single Photo-Electron EXtractor 2

SPEEX2 is a small utility projec to extract the single photoelectron (p.e.) spectrum from a multi-p.e. charge distribution taken by PMT or SiPM. The basic idea is based on the iteration method proposed by Takahashi et al. 2018 \[1\], but we also plan to add an improved method that takes into account the pedestal distribution more accurately.

As of Dec 2020, the program is written in C++ and ROOT, and only the original iteration method, which is not applicable when the pedestal is very dirty, is implemented.
